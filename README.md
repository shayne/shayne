### oh hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shayne, and these days I'm building review.ai â€” we're using AI to help teams understand, share, and learn from how they build software. I've been lucky to work with some incredible teams over the years (was the first engineer at Instagram, worked on React Native at Meta, and more recently led engineering/product at Tailscale), and those experiences got me thinking about how we can make engineering knowledge more discoverable and actionable.

I'm a product engineer at heart â€” someone who loves diving deep into both the technical implementation and product thinking behind great software. Along with building products, I love exploring different passions â€” I'm a licensed pilot and once took a detour from tech to open a craft coffee shop. Life's too short not to pursue the things that spark your curiosity.

#### what I'm working on

Right now I'm obsessed with transforming how engineering teams preserve and share knowledge. We're building a system that captures the full context of software development â€” from code discussions and technical decisions to implementation approaches and review feedback. 

Our first tool, `review`, is the entry point to this vision. It's like having a thoughtful teammate looking over your shoulder while you code, catching issues early and helping you think through your changes. But we're just getting started. We believe teams should be able to systematically track their "knowledge coverage" just like they do with test coverage.

We're building towards a future where:
- Every piece of code tells its complete story - from initial discussions to production
- Teams can measure and systematically improve their knowledge preservation
- Critical context is surfaced exactly when developers need it
- The "why" behind technical decisions is never lost

#### want to chat?

We're bringing on our first beta partners and looking for teams who want to help shape where this goes. If you're interested in making engineering knowledge more accessible and actionable, or just want to geek out about building better development tools (or swap coffee brewing tips!), drop me a line at team@review.ai.
