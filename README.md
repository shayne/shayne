### oh hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shayneâ€”first engineer at Instagram, Reactâ€¯Native alum at Meta, and exâ€‘VPâ€¯Product at Tailscale. 

Now I'm building [review.ai](https://review.ai), where a single prompt spins up a small, purposeâ€‘built app that dives into your data, visualizes it, and surfaces the insight you need. The thinking behind that future shows up in my posts [SaaSâ€¯isâ€¯Dead](https://shayne.dev/blog/saas-is-dead/) and [Endâ€¯ofâ€¯Code](https://shayne.dev/blog/end-of-code/). 

You can find more of my writing at [shayne.dev](https://shayne.dev).

Off the clock I fly small planes and once ran a craft coffee shop.

Always happy to chatâ€”say hi anytime, team@review.ai
